# DailyCommit

A personal challenge to code **every single day** — building on my completed **100 Days of Code** journey.  
This repo is my coding diary, where I commit projects, experiments, and tiny snippets that keep the habit alive.

## 📅 Da Goal
- **Code daily** — No excuses. No pain no gain

## 📖 Motivation
> “Small steps every day lead to big changes.”

This repo isn’t about perfection — it’s about **consistency**. Even 10 minutes of coding counts, because habits build skill.
