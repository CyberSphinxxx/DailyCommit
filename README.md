# DailyCommit

A personal challenge to code **every single day** — building on my completed <a href="https://github.com/CyberSphinxxx/100-Days-of-Code">100 Days of Code</a> journey.  
This repo is my coding diary, where I commit projects, experiments, and tiny snippets that keep the habit alive.

## 📖 Motivation
> “Small steps every day lead to big changes.”

This repo isn’t about perfection — it’s about **consistency**. Even 10 minutes of coding counts, because habits build skill.

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript / TypeScript**
- **React / Tailwind CSS**
- **Python**
